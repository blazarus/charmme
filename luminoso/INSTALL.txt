So you want to install Luminoso from source? Here's the dependencies you'll
need, with hints on where to find them. It's like a scavenger hunt (except less
fun)!

Python 2.6
    From your OS or from http://python.org.

The `gcc` C compiler
    We suggest getting it from the `build-essential` package on Ubuntu, Xcode
    on Mac, and MinGW on Windows.

`pip` or `easy_install`
    These are Python package managers. `pip` is the newer one, but Macs come
    with `easy_install`. You can `sudo easy_install pip`, install the
    `python-pip` Ubuntu package, or download a script that installs it.

The Qt4 libraries
    Get them from http://qt.nokia.com/.

SIP
    A C++ interface that PyQt4 depends on.

PyQt4
    This is separate code from Qt4, and you need both:

NumPy
    An extremely useful library for numerical computing with Python.
    http://numpy.scipy.org

Once you've got all those:

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
    sudo python setup.py develop
